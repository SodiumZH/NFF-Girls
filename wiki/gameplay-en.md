## General befriending methods

### Item-giving process

Right click the mob with certain types of item on the main hand to give. Sometimes the giving action also requires other conditions e.g. player's effects or equipments. When given, the mob's "befriending progress" (or "progress" below) will increase depending on the item type. The initial value is 0, and when it reaches 1, the process is done. (This doesn't always mean to successfully befriend. Sometimes other processes start after this.)

Usually there are both cheap and expensive items to give. Cheap items will push the progress very slightly (usually <10%, sometimes even <1%). (Please note that it has a cooldown time each item given.) Expensive items usually push the progress >10% and, if you're lucky enough, even >50% or immediate success.

If giving succeeded, the mob will generate glint (green star) particles. If failed because of cooldown, the mob will generate smoke particles. Each time the progress increases by 20%, the mob will generate 1 heart particle.

If other conditions are fulfilled but failed because of hostility (has ever been hostile recently), the mob will generate angry particles on given. (Some mobs ignore hostility.)

### Item-Dropping Process

Drop required items on the ground and it will try picking it up like Piglins. It will hold the item for a few seconds, consume it and increase the progress. The progress value mechanism is similar to item-giving process.

#### Interruption

Something may interrupt the process. Once interrupted, the progress will drop back to 0 and everything have to restart. At this time the mob will generate angry particles.



## Bauble System

Bauble system adds several additional "Bauble" slots. These Bauble slots allows to put only specific items and make some effects depending on the item inside.

In DWMG, mobs' Bauble slots are labelled with gem icon. For effects, see "Bauble Items" below.

## Favorability System

Favorability shows the affinity between you and your mob. It's a value between 0 - 100, and 50 initially.

You can slightly increase the favorability by doing things below:

- Sleeping with your mob nearby.
- Attacking and killing enemies with your mob.
- Healing them with items.

Actions below will GREATLY drop the favorability:

- Killing your mob by yourself will drop the favorability to zero.
- Attacking your mob. (If the damage value is below 0.5 it will not drop.)
- Watching your mob die in front of you (-20).

High favorability will increase the mob's attack damage, while low favorability will decrease it. Also, if the favorability is below 5, the mob will refuse to follow you or attack your target.

For their attitudes towards you, be kind to your mobs!

## Experience and Level

Mobs can upgrade their level by killing enemies. If an enemy is killed by a befriended mob, it will not drop EXP Orbs, but the EXP will be directly given to your mob. The EXP amount needed for level-up is identical to players. The given EXP can also fix its equipment with Mending enchantment.

Each level increases the mob's max HP by 1 and attack damage by 0.1.

If the mob dies, it will lose a half of all its EXP accumulated.

## Mob details

#### Zombie Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Using simple item-giving process. (Item giving cooldown 10s)

Accepted items and corresponding progress increase:

*Soul Apple*: 0.04 ~ 0.08

*Soul Powder*: 0.02 ~ 0.04

During the process, you must keep an "Undead Affinity" effect, which makes undead mobs be neutral to you. Also, you must haven't provoked them, either because of attacking them or getting close to them without Undead Affinity effect. Once you provoked them, it will spend ~~15~~ 5 minutes for them to forgive you.

Each time an item is successfully given, glint particles will appear. Each time the favorability increases by 0.2, a heart particle will appear on the mob.

Once you provoked them and/or lost the Undead Affinity effect, the process will be interrupted.

##### Interaction

To interact, player must have a Commanding Wand on either hand.

Right click to switch the AI state among Wait, Follow and Wander. 

Shift + Right click to open inventory. You can customize their armor and hand items. 

(The 2 interaction ways are available for all mobs unless other noted.)

They can be healed by using *Soul Powder* (+5) or *Soul Apple* (+15). (Same for all vanilla undead mob girls.)

They have 2 bauble slots. (Save for Husks and Drowneds.)

#### Stray Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Items accepted:

*Soul Cake Slice*: 1% for 0.60, 4% for 0.45, 15% for 0.30, 80% for 0.15.

*Gunpowder*: 0.015 ~ 0.03.

*TNT*: 0.03 ~ 0.06.

After the progress reaches 1, the Creeper Girl will stop moving, start swelling for 4s and generate tons of glint and smoke particles. After the 4s, it will make a **HUGE EXPLOSION** (Range 12, block-breaking). When it's swelling, you must stay <8 blocks away\(or it will be interrupted and you have to start from giving it items). You must survive from the explosion, and after that it's done.

**Interaction**

Right click with Flint & Steel to ignite it (not consuming the mob).

You can customize its armor and hand items. There's an extra ammo slot (explosive icon), and only with ammo it can explode (no damage to itself, but will damage any other entities including the player and other befriended mobs).

The ammo slot receives either Gunpowder or TNT and consumes one for each explosion. With Gunpowder its explosion has range 3 and doesn't break blocks. With TNT its explosion has range 4 and breaks blocks (if mobGriefing is true). If it's charged, the explosion range will be doubled, 6 for Gunpowder and 8 for TNT, consuming 2 ammo items and uncharging it.

You can manually charge it by using a Particle of Lightning to it. If it's charged, you can right click with bare hand to uncharge it, dropping a Particle of Lightning.

It can be healed with Redstone (5), Gunpowder(5) and Redstone Block(15).

Creeper Girls don't have bauble slots.

##### Features

On combat, it will try exploding on enemies if having ammo, and try close combat if having a weapon on the main hand.

Its explosion can kill the player, but cannot kill other befriended mobs (including tamed animals e.g. vanilla wolves), leaving 1 HP.



#### Ender Executor (HMaG)

##### Befriending

First, look at it to make it be angry with you. When it's less than 8 blocks away, the process starts.

During the process the mob will always be hostile to you. You must do the item-giving process while getting attacked. (Item giving cooldown 15s)

If it failed to attack you for 10s, the progress will drop by 0.2. (If the attack is Shield-blocked, it's still regarded as attacked.)

Accepted items:

*Ender Pie*: 5% for 3/4, 10% for 1/2, 85% for 1/4.

*Ender Plasm*: 0.01 ~ 0.02

*Eye of Ender*: 0.005 ~ 0.01

Once you get >8 blocks away, the process will be interrupted and it will become neutral.

##### Interaction

You can customize its hand items. There's a block slot (cube icon, not available now) and 2 additional Bauble slots.

It can be healed with Eye of Ender(5).



#### Hornet (HMaG)

##### Befriending

With general item-giving process. (Item giving cooldown 10s)

During the whole process, there must be at least 8 Honey Blocks in the 9x9x9 area around it. (As it can fly, probably you need far more than 8 Honey Blocks.) Once there is <8, the progress will drop by 0.1 each second (with large amount of smoke particles). If it damaged you, there will be 60s cooldown during which you cannot give item, but no interruption.

Accepted Items:

*Honey Bottle*: 0.04 - 0.08 (leaving a glass bottle)

*Honey Block*: 0.08 - 0.16

#### Necrotic Reaper (HMaG)

##### Befriending

At first you must be wearing Necromancer's Hat on head and have a Necromancer's Wand.

When it's standing on a Soul Carpet, cast with *Necromancer's Wand* to hit it. 6 hits overall are required. Once hit, it will be always hostile to you. Each time it's hit, it will release more smoke particles, and increase attack damage by 5. 

If it failed to attack you for 10s, the hit count will drop by 1. (If the attack is blocked by shield, it's still regarded as attacked.)

If you get >32 blocks away from it, the process will be interrupted.

##### Interaction

To interact with it, you must either wear a Necromancer's Hat or hold a Necromancer's Wand on either hand. Otherwise it will refuse to follow you or attack your targets. The requirements are removed if its favorability reaches 90.

Necromancer's Wand is required instead of Commanding Wand to switch AI state and open the GUI.

You can customize its hand items. The main hand only accept hoes as weapon. (Non-weapon items are also acceptable, but not taking any effect.)  The offhand slot doesn't accept anything so far. (Will be added in the future.)

Its attack damage greatly increases depending on the tier of the hoe. Efficiency enchantment also increases the attack damage of the hoe, 10% each level.

Hoe attack (only for Necrotic Reapers):  Wood/Gold = 1, Stone = 2, Iron = 3, Diamond = 5, Netherite = 8. Effeciency enhancement will be multiplied to this value, each level provides 10%. For example, a Netherite Hoe with Efficiency V will provide ATK = 8 x (1 + 10% * 5)  = 12. 

*Tip: if other mods provide hoes with higher tier than Netherite, it will be a strong weapon. Tiers above Netherite hoes (without Efficiency) will be subsequently: 13, 21, 34(max).

If the hoe has Fortune enchantment, more items will drop on killing mobs as if it has Looting enchantment.

It has 4 Bauble slots.

It can be healed with Soul Powder (5) and Soul Apple (15).

When it's affected by owner's *Necromancer's Wand* magic ball, it will be healed by 2 (blasted) or 4 (directly hit). If owner is wearing *Necromancer's Hat*, it will be healed by 3 (blasted) or 6 (directly hit), and get Strength effect for 10s (blasted) or 15s (directly hit). 

When the player is wearing a *Necromancer's Hat*, the owning Necrotic Reapers nearby (< 8 blocks) will provide Regeneration effect. The effect level depends on how many Necrotic Reapers there are around. (Regeneration III at most.)



#### Banshee (HMaG)

##### Befriending

To give items, the player must have Wither effect (not the effect of Necromancer's Hat), and there are must >=8 wither roses (blocks) in the 15x15x15 area centered by the mob. Once there're <8, the progress will drop by 0.1 each second. If it damaged you, there will be 60s cooldown during which you cannot give item, but no interruption (no losing progress).

It can be healed by using *Soul Powder* (+5) or *Soul Apple* (+15). (Same as vanilla undead mob girls.)

#### Slime Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Give it magical gel using Magical Gel Bottles, or Magical Gel Balls.

Less difference between Magical Gel Bottle color and Slime Girl color will provide more progress value each unit. For the definition of color difference, see Magical Gel Bottle. If the difference is less than 0.5, the progress will increase, otherwise it will decrease (not dropping below 0).

When the progress increases, it will generate glint (green star) particles; when the progress decreases, it will generate angry particles. The particle amount depends on the absolute progress change, 1 - 40 for stars (difference 0.5 to 0) or 1 - 5 for angry particles (difference 0.5 to 1). 

Tips: To estimate the color of a Slime Girl, you can hit it firstly with Magical Gel Balls to generate a tiny Magical Slime with the complementary color, and collect it with an Empty Magical Gel Bottle to visualize.

For Magical Gel Balls, the progress addition is 0.02 ~ 0.05, and it has 25% chance to spawn a complementary-colored tiny Magical Slime as if hit by a thrown Magical Gel Ball.

#### Melty Monster (0.x.19)

##### Befriending

Using Item-Giving Process.

To give items, the player must be in lava or on fire **without Fire Resistance effect**. Each time given, player will get **Combustion effect (HMaG) for 30 s**.

Accepted items:

*Blaze Powder*: 0.02 - 0.04

*Blaze Rod*: 0.03 - 0.06

*Burning Core*: 0.03 - 0.06

*Burning Core Block* (1.19.2+): 0.12 - 0.24

*Nether Star*: 30% for 1.00, 70% for 0.50

##### Interaction

It has 4 bauble slots.

Equipping it with a lava bucket can change its behavior on the ground: speed-up, and not trying to return to lava.

Using a water bucket will prevent it from igniting the standing blocks, while Flint and Steel will enable igniting. (Right click the mob to use, not placing water! Or it will damage the mob!)

Having lava-bath with it will gradually boost the favorability, 1 per minute. (Both player and the mob are in lava, can see each other, and are less 3 blocks away.)

It can be healed with Coal (5), Fire Charge (10), Blaze Powder (15) and Burning Core (to max).

##### Features

It has a property of "heat". Getting out of lava will consume heat (2 / second; 1 / second when equipping lava bucket). Getting in lava will recover heat (5 / second). If heat runs out, it will not be able to fire, the movement speed will decrease, and will try returning to lava even if equipping lava bucket.

The upper limit of heat is initially 10,000 and will increase by 1,000 each level-up.

It can fire like Blaze, consuming 5 heat each fireball. When its level reaches 15, 30, 60 and 80, it will shoot more fireballs per firing action. (This also means it will consume heat more quickly.)



#### Nightwalker (0.x.20) (1.19.2+ only)

##### Befriending

Using Item-Giving Process.

Glazed Terracotta => Terracotta (of the same color)

Terracotta => Clay

Accepted items:

It can be healed with Clay Ball (2), Lapis Lazuli (5), Ancient Stone (15) and Golden Apple (to max).

#### Magical Gel Ball

A throwable item.

If a thrown Magical Gel Ball hits a large Vanilla Slime, it has a chance of 25% to generate a tiny Magical Slime with random color.

If it hits a Slime Girl (HMaG, befriended or not), it has a chance of 25% to generate a tiny Magical Slime with the Slime Girl's complementary color. For example, a red Slime Girl will generate a cyan Magical Slime. (Since Magical Slimes and non-befriended Slime Girls have only 32 fixed colors, the real color is probably not absolutely identical to the calculated complementary color.)

If it hits non-slime mobs, it will make a non-damaging knockback like the Snow Ball, and give Slowness II effect of 30 s.



#### Magical Gel Bottle

An item for befriending Slime Girls and change befriended Slime Girls' colors.

##### Collecting

The maximum content of each bottle is 6. If you're collecting with a full bottle, the extra gel unit will drop as a Magical Gel Ball after blending. 

##### Coloring

Besides blending more Magical Slimes, you can also change the gel color by crafting with HMaG ingredients. In this case, the bottle content will not change. (For accepted ingredients as dyes, see table below.)

##### Usage

Right click your befriended Slime Girl to change its color. Each unit of Magical Gel used, the gel color will be blended with previous color with the proportion ratio of 1 : 4, and it has a chance of 25% to drop an extra Magical Gel Ball.

Craft with a Slimeball to transfer it to Magical Gel Ball, consuming 1 unit of bottle content.

Craft with an Empty Magical Gel Bottle to separate the content into 2 bottles.

##### Numerical Formulas

Collecting Magical Slime:
$$
newColor = (oldColor * content + slimeColor)/(content + 1)
$$
Staining with items on Crafting Table:
$$
newColor = (oldColor * content + dyeColor * strength)/(content + strength)
$$
Color difference is defined as the normalized straight-line distance in the RGB space:
$$
difference = sqrt[(R1-R2)^2+(G1-G2)^2+(B1-B2)^2] /sqrt(3*255^2)
$$

A weapon especially effective to undead mobs. It cannot sweep.

When attacking undead mobs (except "wild" Jiangshi, but including befriended ones), it will make the damage half of the mob's max health, bypassing all vanilla damage-reduction mechanisms (armor, enchantment, effect), at most 50. Dealing extra damage will cause extra durability cost. (It has only durability of wooden sword!)

For non-undead mobs, it's same as a normal Wooden Sword.
